I head the AI and Computer Vision research at [Streem](https://streem.pro) where we are making cameras smart enough to solve users problems right where they are. 

Before, I led the tech behind [Selerio](https://selerio.io), where we made interactions between the real world and the virtual world easier than never before. Selerio was spun-out from my PhD work in the Rainbow group (University of Cambridge), under the supervision of Prof. Neil Dodgson and Prof. Peter Robinson. <!--More about this at my official website www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fp289 .-->

Check my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=sDRsbs8AAAAJ&hl=en) page for some of the papers that came out from that work and all of my other research.
Selected highlights:
- [Shape2Vec: Semantic-based Descriptors For 3D Shapes, Sketches and Images](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/shape2vec/)
- [Cluster-based Point Set Saliency](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/pointsetsaliency/)
- [Shading Curves: Vector-Based Drawing With Explicit Gradient Control](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/shadingcurves/)

### Where I come from
Born and raised in Douala, Cameroon. I then spent 5 years in South Africa, before coming to the UK late 2012.

### Research
I specialize in AI, Computer vision, and 3D Graphics. 

My PhD was looking at new machine learning techniques for 3D shape retrieval from partial queries. Prior to this project, I worked on enhanced texture-based terrain synthesis on GPU and crowd simulation of virtual autonomous pedestrians. 

My research interests lie in using data-driven methods for semantic-aware scene understanding, 3D modelling, content-based shape retrieval and sketch-based interfaces. Take a look at some open-source code [@ftasse](https://github.com/ftasse).

### Selected extracurricular activities
- [Black in AI workshops](https://blackinai.github.io/)
- Anita Borg Alumni Community planning committee 2014/2015 : Aiming to reach 15000 women in tech around the world
- women@CL committee member 2015/2016: women@CL supports women in the University of Cambridge Computer Lab

### Work in progress
- [Sketch2Shape](https://ftasse.github.io/Sketch2Shape): Turning your clumsy :) hand-drawn sketches into 3D shapes. AI Grant recipient.
- [Observers](https://theobservers.org): Using AI and social media to map public opinion about societal issues. Google Cloud Dev Challenge finalist.

### Hobbies
- Ballroom and Latin Dancesport
- Lots of reading and some writing
