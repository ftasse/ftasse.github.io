### Welcome fellow human and others!

I lead the tech behind Selerio.io, where we are making interactions between the real world and the virtual world easier than never before. Before that, I was a PhD student in the Rainbow group (University of Cambridge), under the supervision of Neil Dodgson and Peter Robinson. <!--More about this at my official website www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fp289 -->.
Check my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=sDRsbs8AAAAJ&hl=en) page for some of the papers that came out from that research: 

### Where I come from
Born and raised in Douala, Cameroon. I then spent 5 years in South Africa, before coming to the UK late 2012. 

### Higher Education
- University of Cambridge (UK) - PhD in Computer Science - 2012/2016
- University of Cape Town (SA) - Msc in Computer Science - 2009/2011
- Rhodes University (SA) - Bsc Honours in Computer Science - 2008

### Research
I specialize in 3D Graphics and Computer vision. 
I am currently looking at 3D shape retrieval from partial queries. Prior to this project, I worked on enhanced texture-based terrain synthesis on GPU and crowd simulation of virtual autonomous pedestrians. My research interests lie in sketch-based interfaces, 3D modelling, and content-based information retrieval. Take a look at some open-source code @ftasse.
